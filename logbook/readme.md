# Introduction
This logbook folder keeps a record of:

- discussions, thoughts, ideas about the data & code
- major changes in data and code
- questions and background info leading to different model runs or experements
- interpretations of different outputs from model experiments

# Further explanation
The logbook-entries need to be added in chronological order, but still the logbook-structure might be not completely straightforward 
(for example if it consists of multiple files and different types of headers).
In that case you should provide an explanation of the key-words and structure of the logbook in this readme.
