# Introduction
This folder contains the data files used during model development.
The subfolder ./original/ contains original data and these files should be set to read-only.
The subfolder ./derived/ contains derived data and synthetic data, that can be (re)created via scripts.

# Every data file gets an entry in this readme
Provide for each data file (both the original data and the derived data) a complete description of what it contains.
This comprises at least:

- a full explanation of all variables (names, units, meaning of categorical labels etc.)
- for original data: the full info about its source (with a doi and proper citation) accompanied with license-info
- for derived data: a pointer to the code which generated it
